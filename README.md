Task 3: College Event Feedback Analysis:
Thrilled to announce the completion of my Task 3! I developed a data-driven evaluation system to analyze student feedback and measure the effectiveness of academic event delivery and course relevance.

Overall Performance: Evaluated 8 key performance indicators across 1,000+ responses, identifying a peak average rating of 7.50/10 in Instructor Expertise.

Top Strength: The "Subject Mastery" category dominated student satisfaction, reflecting high confidence in the depth of content delivered.

Improvement Insight: Pinpointed a critical gap in Assignment Difficulty (5.43 score) and Doubt Resolution (5.47 score), highlighting these as the primary areas to address to boost overall course recommendation.

Student Sentiment: Visualized the distribution of recommendation scores, identifying a polarized audience sentiment that suggests the need for more personalized learning support.

Correlation Analysis: Used heatmaps to uncover that Instructional Clarity has the strongest impact on a student’s willingness to recommend the course to others.

Skills Applied: Statistical Data Analysis, Sentiment Trend Visualization, Correlation Mapping, and Data Cleaning using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib).
